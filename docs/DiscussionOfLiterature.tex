Douglas Davis, William Ribarsky, T.Y. Jiang, Nickolas Faust and Sean Ho \cite{Davis} present a method of rendering large collections of heterogeneous objects. By applying hierarchical paging procedures to terrain and buildings, they are able to visualize out-of-core collections of 3D objects (e.g. cities) in real-time. Further they present a method for efficient handling of culling on large collections of buildings. Finally, the use of level of detail can be incorporated to provide detail management. All of these procedures could be applied to solve part of the main of the problem.
