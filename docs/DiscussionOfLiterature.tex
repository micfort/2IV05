\chapter{Discussion of literature}
Douglas Davis, William Ribarsky, T.Y. Jiang, Nickolas Faust and Sean Ho [6] present a method of rendering large collections of heterogeneous objects. By applying hierarchical paging procedures to terrain and buildings, they are able to visualize out-of-core collections of 3D objects (e.g. cities) in real-time.  Further they present the method efficient handling of culling on large collections of buildings. Finally, the use of levels of detail can be incorporated to provide detail management. This can be applied to solve the main part of the problem.
