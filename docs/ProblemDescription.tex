\label{chapter:ProblemDescription}
The main problem with this project is that the amount of data from the BAG and OpenStreetMap that has to be rendered is larger than the amount of memory available. Also amount of processing power needed to render all the models and the terrain in real-time is too large and is not available in a consumer pc.

\section{Sub problems}
\label{chapter:SubProblems}
This problem is can be divided in multiple sub problems.
\begin{itemize}
   \item Render less information, without a big concessions on the image quality
   \item Determine what data has to be rendered and what not
   \item Still render the image in real-time
\end{itemize}
Solutions to these problems are presented in section.
