\label{chapter:ProblemDescription}
The main problem of this project is to build an interactive system that allows the real-time rendering of a large geographic data set in 3D. This goal gives rise to the following sub-problems:
\begin{itemize}
   \item Data from the geographic data set has to be processed and filtered
   \item Geographic models have to be generated from the process data
   \item The amount of memory and processing power available in common consumer computers is insufficient to hold and render all the models
\end{itemize}
Solutions to these problems are presented in section \ref{chap:AnalysisAndSolution}.
